- 👋 Hi, I’m @samuelfchang
- 👀 I’m interested in ... many things! From bioinformatics and using multi-omic approaches to answer questions about the pathophysiological development of disease (as par of my PhD work), to learning more about coding and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Unix/Bash for upstream RNA-Seq analysis, and R for differential gene expression analysis via DESeq2.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... projects related to transcriptomics, epigenetics and the intersection of multiple "-omic" fields.
- 📫 How to reach me ... sfchang@uab.edu
