- 👋 Hi, I’m @samuelfchang
- 👀 I’m interested in ... many things! Overall, my PhD Thesis work aims to merge the wet and dry lab. Not only performing bioinformatic analyses, but also taking those results and diving deep into the molecular biology and biological validation. On the coding side, from bioinformatics and using multi-omic approaches to answer questions about the pathophysiological development of disease (as part of my PhD work), to learning more about coding and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Bash Unix shell for upstream RNA-Seq analysis, and R for differential gene expression analysis via DESeq2.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... projects related to transcriptomics, epigenetics and the intersection of multiple "-omic" fields.
- 📫 How to reach me ... sfchang@uab.edu
